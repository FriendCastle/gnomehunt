# Release the Gnomes!

# Gnome Hunt

## What is Gnome Hunt?
Gnome Hunt is tech demo made to showcase Niantic's new Lighship ARDK 3.0.

In this demo, players will be able to go to a real life location to participate in a gnome easter egg hunt.

At the end of the game, the player will be able to modify a piece of the AR experience and the next user that plays will be able to see it.
