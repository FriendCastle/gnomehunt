# Release the Gnomes!

# Gnome Hunt

See **develop** branch for current work.

## What is Gnome Hunt?
Gnome Hunt is tech demo made to showcase Niantic's new Lighship ARDK 3.0.

In this demo, players will be able to go to a real life location to participate in a gnome easter egg hunt.

At the end of the game, the player will be able to modify a piece of the AR experience and the next user that plays will be able to see it.

## Development

For this project, we are specifically focused on utilizing Lightship's VPS location based AR and persistence tracking.

### Questions

How do we utilize Lightship's API so that users on different devices can see the same persistent AR/changes to specific locations?

### Issues Encountered

### Findings
